Wave Event Protocal
--------------------

Job: Facilitates communicating live changes to the client.
Existing Standards: JSON, HTTP stream, UNIX time stamp, wave format

Overview:
---
When downloading this stream, you will recieve JSON objects containing events, wavelet, and blips. The events communicate changes that have accord  on the wave. The wavelet and blips provide a context for the change.

Connection:
---
The event protocal requires a one directional stream, client settings looked up via a session.

Format:
---
The root JSON object of a certain section of the stream contains the following format:
{
   events : [Event . . .],
   wavelet : {
      creationTime : Number (of ms),
      creator : String (wave address),
      lastModifiedTime : Number (of ms),
      participants : [String (wave address) . . .],
      rootBlipId : String,
      title : String,
      version : Number,
      waveId : String,
      waveletId : String,
      dataDocuments : {docId : object (data), . . .}
   }
   blips : {
      blipId : Blip, . . .
   }
}
Event objects are in the following format:
{
   modifiedBy : String (wave address),
   timestamp : Number (of ms),
   type : String,
   properties : object (type defined)
}
And Blips are in the following format:
{
   annotations : [Annotation . . .],
   elements :
   blipId : String,
   childBlipIds : [String . . .],
   contributors : [String (wave address) . . .],
   creator : String (wave address),
   content : String,
   lastModifiedTime : Number (of ms),
   version : Number,
   waveletId : String,
   waveId : String
}
The annotations there are formatted:
{
   range : {
      start : Number,
      end : Number,
   },
   key : String,
   value : Integer,
}

Types:
---
Wavelet:
--
 Properties		Description
 ----------		-----------
 creationTime		Number of milliseconds from epoch till wave started.
 creator		The user who created the wave.
 lastModifiedTime	Number of milliseconds from epoch till last change.
 participants		Array of the wave addresses of the participants
			on the wave.
 rootBlipId		The ID of the root blip as a String.
 title			The title of the wave as a String.
 version		The numbered version of the wave.
 waveId			The waveId of the containing wave as a String.
 waveletId		The waveletId of the wavelet.
 dataDocuments		Object associating document IDs to objects of their
			data.

Blip:
--
 Properties		Description
 ----------		-----------
 blipId			contains the ID of blip in which the event
			occurred.
 childBlipIds		contains an array of blip IDs for each of the
			blip's children.
 contributors		denotes participants who have contributed to the
			state of this blip.
 creator		denotes the participant who created this blip.
 lastModifiedTime	denotes the Unix time at which this blip was last
			modified by any participant.
 content		contains the textual content of this blip.
 version		contains the version of this blip. Each atomic
			operation on a blip increases this version number.
 waveId			contains the Wave ID associated with this blip.
 waveletId		contains the wavelet ID associated with this blip.

 (optional:)
 annotations		array of annotations associated with the blip. The
			annotation is represented by an object with range
			(containing start and end properties), key, and
			value.
 elements		contains gadgets, controls, and attachments
			associated with the blip.

Events:
--
 Properties		Description
 ----------		-----------
 type			A string designating the event, possible values are
			listed in the following "Event Types" table.
 modifiedBy		The wave address of the user who made this change
			as a String.
 timestamp		The unix timestamp of when the update accord.
 properties		An object with properties donoted by the type
			property.
