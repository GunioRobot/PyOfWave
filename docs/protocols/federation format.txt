Federation Format
--------------------

Job: This standard defines a document structure that can be passed around in the federation standard. 
Existing Standards: Federation Protocal, Wave Format, XML (illustrative), 
		DTD (illustrative)

Overview
---
A wavelet is made up of several documents, one for the wavelet, and one for each blip. The blips and the wavelet use different tag names (illustrated as XML & DTD), which is explained in this document. 

Wavelet
---
This document describes how the wavelet document organizes into a wave. 

Tags
--
 Tag			Property		Description
 ---			--------		--------------
 conversation					Contains a sequence of blips. 
 			sort            	The order of wavelets by 
						lexicographical order. 
			anchorWavelet		The wavelet it is contained in. 
			anchorManifastOffset	Index into parent document. 
			anchorVersion		The version the wavelet was 
						created. 
			anchorBlip		The ID of the blip the wavelet 
						is attached to.
			anchorOffset		The offset in the attached blip 
						the wavelet is placed.
			<blip/>*		The contained blips.
 blip						Points to a blip document. 
			id			Points to the document of the 
						blip.
			deleted			Marks the wave as being deleted
			<thread/>*		Optional additional structure.
			<peer/>*		Includes any data documents.
 thread						Contains another sequence of 
						blips. 
			id			The thread's id.
			inline			Marks that the thread is 
						located inside the blip 
						document.
			<blip/>*		Contained blips.
 peer						Points to a data document (for 
						gadgets). 
			id			Points to the document. This 
						document is one tag with a 
						number of attributes.

Blip
---
The blips contain the rich text messages of the wave. This document describes the structure of these rich text messages.

Tags

 Tag			Elements		Description
 ---			--------		-----------
 contributor					Points to a person who edited 
						the blip.
			name			The user's Wave Address.
 body						Contains the display of the 
						wave.
 line						Marks a line of text.
			t			The type out of (h1,h2,h3,h4, 
						h5,li) as in HTML.
			i			indentation level as a number.
						Only meaningful with t=li.
			a			The alignment from (a, m, r, j) 
						for align left, center, right, 
						and justified.
			d			direction of text from (l, r).
 attachment					Represents a file (could be an 
						image, file, or gadget).
			src			The URL of the attachment.
 reply						Marks the location of an inline 
						thread.
			id			The ID of the thread from the 
						manifast.

Text may also be provided annotations as described in wave format.
